                <h2>The Americas cup</h2>
                <p>
                    The trophy’s roots date back to when a syndicate of
                    businessmen from New York sailed the schooner America
                    across
                    the Atlantic Ocean for the World’s Fair in England. The
                    schooner won a race around the Isle of Wight against a
                    fleet
                    of British yachts to claim the £100 Cup.
                    From there, the United States embarked on what would
                    become
                    the longest winning streak in the history of sport. A
                    132-year stretch saw boats representing the country
                    successfully defend the trophy 24 times from 1870
                    through
                    1980—until 1983, when Australia II became the first
                    successful challenger to lift the trophy from the
                    Americans.
                    Throughout its history, the America’s Cup has enchanted
                    leaders of industry and royalty from tea merchant Sir
                    Thomas
                    Lipton, to brewing and real estate mogul Alan Bond,
                    aviation
                    pioneer Sir T.O.M. Sopwith, the Aga Khan, media mogul
                    Ted
                    Turner, and Harold S. Vanderbilt.
                    Not to mention the icons of the sport of sailing such as
                    Tom
                    Blackaller, Peter Blake, Dennis Conner and Russell
                    Coutts
                    and Grant Dalton.

                <h2>Legacy Begins - ‘Your Majesty, there is no second'</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1851 a radical looking schooner ghosted out of the
                    afternoon mist and swiftly sailed past the Royal Yacht
                    stationed in the Solent, between the Isle of Wight and
                    the
                    south coast of England, on an afternoon when Queen
                    Victoria
                    was watching a sailing race.
                    As the schooner, named America, passed the Royal Yacht
                    in
                    first position, and saluted by dipping its ensign three
                    times, Queen Victoria asked one of her attendants to
                    tell
                    her who was in second place. ”Your Majesty, there is no
                    second,” came the reply. That phrase, just four words,
                    is
                    still the best description of the America’s Cup, and how
                    it
                    represents the singular pursuit of excellence.
                    That day in August, 1851, the yacht America,
                    representing
                    the young New York Yacht Club, would go on to beat the
                    best
                    the British could offer and win the Royal Yacht
                    Squadron’s
                    100 Pound Cup. This was more than a simple boat race
                    however, as it symbolised a great victory for the new
                    world
                    over the old, a triumph that unseated Great Britain as
                    the
                    world’s undisputed maritime power.
                    The trophy would go to the young democracy of the United
                    States and it would be well over 100 years before it was
                    taken away from New York.
                    Shortly after America won the 100 Guinea Cup in 1851,
                    New
                    York Yacht Club Commodore John Cox Stevens and the rest
                    of
                    his ownership syndicate sold the celebrated schooner and
                    returned home to New York as heroes. They donated the
                    trophy
                    to the New York Yacht Club under a Deed of Gift, which
                    stated that the trophy was to be “a perpetual challenge
                    cup
                    for friendly competition between nations.”
                    Thus was born the America’s Cup, named after the winning
                    schooner America.
                    The America’s Cup is without a doubt the most difficult
                    trophy in sport to win. In the more than 160 years since
                    that first race off England, only four nations have won
                    what
                    is often called the “oldest trophy in international
                    sport.”
                    For some perspective, consider that there had been nine
                    contests for the America’s Cup before the first modern
                    Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.
                </p>
                <h2>Early Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    The very first challenge would come from Englishman
                    James
                    Ashbury, who raced against a fleet from the New York
                    Yacht
                    Club just off Staten Island in 1870. After much dispute
                    over
                    the conditions for racing, Ashbury’s Cambria finished
                    tenth
                    in the 17 boat fleet, prompting a second challenge the
                    following year.
                    The 1871 America’s Cup match was a precursor for many of
                    the
                    legal battles that would engulf the Cup over the next
                    100
                    years. After reportedly consulting his lawyers, Ashbury
                    insisted on racing against just one boat, not an entire
                    fleet and protested both the scoring of the races and
                    the
                    Race Committee who set the race course. In the end he
                    limped
                    home complaining bitterly about poor sportsmanship on
                    the
                    part of the Americans and insisting he had actually won
                    the
                    America’s Cup, to no avail.
                    The next two Challenges came from Canada, but the
                    northerners were no match for the Americans and were
                    soundly
                    beaten.
                </p>
                <h2>The Lipton Era</h2>
                <p>
                    There were a further six challenges before the turn of
                    the
                    Century, including the first of what came to be called
                    the
                    Lipton era of the America’s Cup. Sir Thomas Lipton, the
                    Irish/Scottish tea baron challenged five times between
                    1899
                    and 1930. He became the loveable loser; a man whose
                    good-natured approach to the obstacles stacked against
                    him
                    turned him into a folk hero and promoted his business
                    interests in America as well.
                    While Lipton didn’t win the America’s Cup, he became one
                    of
                    the first to introduce the idea of sports sponsorship,
                    and
                    he realised a financial windfall from it. Lipton’s final
                    challenge in 1930 was the first in the new J-Class
                    boats.
                    This was a period of magnificent beauty afloat, as the
                    towering masts carrying an improbable amount of sail
                    powered
                    through the chop off Newport, Rhode Island. Harold
                    Vanderbilt was selected to defend for the New York Yacht
                    Club that year and did so with ease.
