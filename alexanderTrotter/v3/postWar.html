                <h2>Post War</h2>

                <p>
                    The Second World War marked the end of the J-Class, and when
                    America’s Cup racing began again in 1958, it signalled the
                    beginning of the 12-Metre era. The Americans would
                    successfully
                    defend eight more times over the next 25-year period.
                    Sadly, in 1939, all but three of the original ten J’s were
                    used
                    as scrap metal for the war effort. The three surviving
                    J-Class
                    yachts have been restored and still sail in regattas around
                    the
                    world.

                <h2>Challenger Series</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1970, more than one yacht club interested in challenging
                    for
                    the America’s Cup, so for the first time, a competition was
                    staged to determine the single Challenger that would face
                    the
                    Defender, the New York Yacht Club.
                    The French malletier Louis Vuitton became involved with the
                    America’s Cup in 1983, supporting the Challenger Selection
                    Series that came to be known as the Louis Vuitton Cup. The
                    idea
                    was twofold; to develop and identify the strongest possible
                    challenger for the America’s Cup and ensure that they were
                    sufficiently battle-tested through tough competition to beat
                    the
                    Defender.
                    The defenders had been involved in this type of selection
                    series
                    for most of the century, but until recently, there had been
                    but
                    one Challenger.

                <h2>The Cup Leaves America</h2>
                <p>
                    Australia was one of the challenging countries in 1983, and
                    the
                    ‘Men from Down Under’ brought a secret weapon. Australia II
                    sported a boxing Kangaroo flag in the rigging as she was
                    towed
                    out to sea, and under the water, a radically-designed winged
                    keel that gave the 12-Metre Class boat superior speed under
                    most
                    conditions. The Australians kept the secret to themselves,
                    draping large ‘modesty skirts’ from the deck to the ground
                    when
                    the boat was hauled from the water – keeping prying eyes
                    away
                    and all the time building speculation as to what could be
                    under
                    there.
                    Dennis Conner, ‘Mr. America’s Cup’, was charged with
                    defending
                    against the upstart Australians, who handily whipped through
                    the
                    challenger fleet and carried off the first Louis Vuitton
                    Cup.
                    That summer, in 1983, the America’s Cup had pride of place
                    on
                    every newscast, and front-page status in every paper. There
                    was
                    a sense of history about that season; that somehow, finally,
                    the
                    New York Yacht Club’s 132-year winning streak was going to
                    come
                    to an end. Equipment problems on the Australian boat allowed
                    Conner to jump ahead early in the best of seven series, but
                    Australian skipper John Bertrand battled back, eventually
                    bringing the series to a score line of 3-3.
                    The seventh and final race was symbolic of the entire
                    series,
                    with Conner’s Liberty leading for most of the course in a
                    light
                    and shifty breeze. It was not until the final spinnaker run
                    that
                    Australia II was able to jump into the lead, and then hold
                    on to
                    it despite a ferocious, last-gasp assault over the last few
                    minutes. For the first time in 132 years, the America’s Cup
                    was
                    leaving the New York Yacht Club.
                    Conner, then representing the San Diego Yacht Club, won the
                    right to fight another day in 1987. Held in Fremantle, he
                    won
                    the Louis Vuitton Cup to become the Challenger and then
                    delivered a shut-out victory of 4-0. This America’s Cup
                    featured
                    quite an on-the-water show, with the famous “Fremantle
                    Doctor,”
                    strong afternoon sea-breezes, blowing up incredible sailing
                    conditions with giant white-capped seas, to challenge both
                    the
                    sailors and equipment.

                <h2>The Return to America</h2>
                <p>
                    Dennis Conner's Comeback in 1987 (AC26)
                    Dennis Conner, basking in presidential welcomes and
                    ticker-tape
                    parades through New York, was in no rush to settle the
                    details
                    of the next event, and New Zealand, exploiting a loophole in
                    the
                    century old Deed of Gift, demanded an immediate challenge in
                    1988. What resulted was the first America’s Cup Finals where
                    two
                    different styles of boat raced each other, with the Kiwis in
                    a
                    giant 90-foot waterline boat against Conner in a much
                    smaller
                    but faster hard-winged catamaran. The best of three series
                    went
                    to the Americans and after numerous court challenges – the
                    teams
                    spent far more time battling in a courtroom than they did on
                    the
                    water – the result stood.
