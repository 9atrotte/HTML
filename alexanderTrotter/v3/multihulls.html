                <h1>Multihull Battle</h1>
                <h2>Multihull Battle</h2>
                <p>
                    Shortly after successfully defending the Cup, SNG announced
                    it had accepted a challenge from a newly formed yacht club,
                    the Spanish CNEV, and released a Protocol for the 33rd
                    America’s Cup.
                    Many in the America’s Cup community balked at the terms in
                    the Protocol and BMW ORACLE Racing, with Larry Ellison
                    leading the charge, challenged the validity of the new
                    Spanish club. The courts agreed and GGYC became the
                    challenger of record. When GGYC and SNG were unable to
                    mutually consent on a new Protocol, the 33rd America’s Cup
                    became a ‘Deed of Gift’ Match, as in 1988.
                    There were numerous court challenges, initiated by both
                    sides. In the end, both teams having learned the lesson of
                    1988, built enormous multihulls. Then, just months before
                    the race, BMW ORACLE Racing replaced its soft sail rig with
                    a towering wing sail – the largest wing ever built.
                    When the boats finally lined up to race off Valencia in
                    February 2010, the BMW ORACLE Racing trimaran with its
                    powerful wing sail proved to be superior. Skipper James
                    Spithill, just 30 years old, won with a record of 2-0. Once
                    again, the America’s Cup would be defended by an American
                    Team in the 34th edition.
                </p>
                <h2>Battle on the Bay</h2>
                <img src="images/teamNz.jpg" alt="teamNz" id="teamNz">
                <p>
                    The speed, the thrill and the challenge of building
                    multihulls proved irresistible and ORACLE TEAM USA elected
                    to make the AC72, a catamaran powered by a towering
                    wingsail, the class for the 34th America’s Cup. The venue
                    would be the iconic San Francisco Bay, where late summer
                    winds were predictable and strong.
                    Emirates Team New Zealand was among three challengers (along
                    with Artemis Racing and Luna Rossa Challenge) lined up to
                    battle ORACLE TEAM USA.
                    The Kiwis, always pushing the boundaries of innovation were
                    the first team to bring foiling to the America’s Cup
                    enabling the AC72 to get up and out of the water, foiling,
                    and soon all the teams were flying above the water at speeds
                    over 40 knots.
                    Emirates Team New Zealand’s ingenuity would revolutionize
                    the modern America’s Cup to a high speed and action packed
                    event focused on a younger and athletic generation of
                    sailors.
                    The boats were without risk however, and ORACLE TEAM USA
                    capsized during training on San Francisco Bay, all but
                    destroying one of their boats and setting their program back
                    by months.
                    Tragically, Artemis Racing also had a training accident and
                    crew member Andrew ‘Bart’ Simpson perished when he became
                    trapped under the capsized boat. His memory lives on through
                    the Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation, a charity devoted to
                    youth sailing projects.
                    With new safety regulations developed following the
                    accident, racing started in the challenger series, where
                    Emirates Team New Zealand made short work of Artemis Racing
                    and Luna Rossa Challenge.
                    The Kiwis then jumped out to an impressive lead in the
                    America’s Cup Match over ORACLE TEAM USA, who couldn’t match
                    the New Zealander’s upwind speed.
                    After making a critical crew change, bringing on Ben Ainslie
                    for John Kostecki, and making continual modifications to
                    their boat and sailing techniques, the Americans were
                    getting faster, but were running out of time. Emirates Team
                    New Zealand reached match point, building an 8-1 lead.
                    But improbably, ORACLE TEAM USA turned the tide and began to
                    win races. The gap narrowed and then disappeared. Now it was
                    ORACLE TEAM USA who were faster and the score was tied, 8-8.
                    There would be one last race; the winner would claim the
                    Cup.
                    The final race was a microcosm of the match itself. Emirates
                    Team New Zealand had an early lead, but couldn’t fend off
                    the American boat. ORACLE TEAM USA sailed into history,
                    taking the closest match in America’s Cup history, 9-8.

                <h2>The Battle of Bermuda </h2>
                <p>
                    Oracle Team USA decided to take the event out of their home
                    country to the pristine island of Bermuda for the 35th
                    edition.
                    After a torrid few years following the brutal defeat in San
                    Francisco, Emirates Team New Zealand quietly rebuilt a
                    refreshed young and hungry team Skippered by Glenn Ashby and
                    helmed by Olympic Gold Medalist Peter Burling.
                    Developing their campaign in silo in their home base of
                    Auckland, New Zealand while most other challengers and the
                    defenders Oracle Team USA set up camp in Bermuda, the kiwis
                    continued to innovate and push the boundaries in secrecy by
                    “Throwing the ball as far as possible in terms of design and
                    innovation to see if they could reach it.”
                    They surprised the sailing and America’s Cup world just a
                    few months before the start of the event, but launching a
                    revolutionary boat with ‘cyclors’ powering their AC50
                    catamaran.
                    Their boat concept was so far advanced there was no time for
                    the innovation to be replicated this time, despite futile
                    attempts by the Oracle Team USA.
                    Emirates Team New Zealand, won all of their double round
                    robin races except their two races against the defender
                    Oracle team USA who were racing in the Challenger Selection
                    Series for the first time in history providing the American
                    team with a false sense of hope.
                    The hardened kiwis came back from a near catastrophic
                    capsize to beat Land Rover BAR in the semi finals and then
                    the Swedish team Artemis Racing in the Louis Vuitton Cup
                    Final, providing the ticket for a heavy weight rematch
                    against Oracle Team USA, who went into the match with a 1
                    point lead.
                    Emirates Team New Zealand’s push for redemption was swift, a
                    dominant display blew Oracle Team USA away 7-1 to win the
                    America’s Cup for the third time.
