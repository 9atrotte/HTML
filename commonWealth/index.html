                        A sporting competition bringing together the members of
                        the British Empire was first proposed by John Astley
                        Cooper in 1891, who wrote letters and articles for
                        several periodicals suggesting a "Pan Brittanic, Pan
                        Anglican Contest every four years as a means of
                        increasing goodwill and understan’ding of the British
                        Empire."[10] John Astley Cooper Committees were formed
                        in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to promote
                        the idea and inspired Pierre de Coubertin to start the
                        international Olympic Games movement.[11][12]

                        In 1911, an Inter-Empire Championship was held alongside
                        the Festival of Empire, at The Crystal Palace in London
                        to celebrate the coronation of George V, and were
                        championed by The Earl of Plymouth and Lord
                        Desborough.[13][14] Teams from Australasia (Australia
                        and New Zealand), Canada, South Africa, and the United
                        Kingdom competed in events for athletics, boxing,
                        swimming and wrestling.[15] Canada won the championships
                        and was presented with a silver cup (gifted by Lord
                        Lonsdale) which was 2 feet 6 inches (76 cm) high and
                        weighed 340 ounces (9.6 kg). A correspondent of the
                        Auckland Star criticised the Games, calling them a
                        "grievous disappointment" that were "not worthy of the
                        title of 'Empire Sports'".[16]

                        Melville Marks Robinson, who went to the 1928 Summer
                        Olympics in Amsterdam to serve as the manager of the
                        Canadian track and field team, strongly lobbied for the
                        proposal of organising the first British Empire Games in
                        Hamilton in 1930.[17]

                        The Commonwealth Games, often referred to as the
                        Friendly
                        Games,[1] is a quadrennial international multi-sport
                        event
                        among athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The
                        event
                        was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942
                        and
                        1946 (cancelled due to World War II), have successively
                        run
                        every four years since.[2] The Games were called the
                        British
                        Empire Games from 1930 to 1950, the British Empire and
                        Commonwealth Games from 1954 to 1966, and British
                        Commonwealth Games from 1970 to 1974. Athletes with a
                        disability are included as full members of their
                        national
                        teams since 2002, making the Commonwealth Games the
                        first
                        fully inclusive international multi-sport event.[3] In
                        2018,
                        the Games became the first global multi-sport event to
                        feature an equal number of men's and women's medal
                        events
                        and four years later they are the first global
                        multi-sport
                        event to have more events for women than men.[4]
                        Inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships, part of the
                        1911
                        Festival of Empire, Melville Marks Robinson founded the
                        British Empire Games which were first held in Hamilton,
                        Canada in 1930.[5] As time progressed, the Games
                        evolved,
                        adding the Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for athletes
                        with a
                        disability (who were barred from competing from 1974
                        before
                        being fully integrated by 1990)[6] and the Commonwealth
                        Youth Games for athletes aged 14 to 18.

                        The Games are overseen by the Commonwealth Games
                        Federation
                        (CGF), which controls the sporting programme and selects
                        host cities. The games movement consists of
                        international
                        sports federations (IFs), Commonwealth Games
                        Associations
                        (CGAs) and organising committees for each specific
                        Commonwealth Games. Certain traditions, such as the
                        hoisting
                        of the Commonwealth Games flag and Queen's Baton Relay,
                        as
                        well as the opening and closing ceremonies, are unique
                        to
                        the Games. Over 4,500 athletes competed at the latest
                        Commonwealth Games in 25 sports and over 250 medal
                        events,
                        including Olympic and Paralympic sports and those
                        popular in
                        Commonwealth countries: bowls and squash.[7] Usually,the
                        first, second and third-place finishers in each event
                        are
                        awarded gold, silver and bronze medals, respectively. ⁹
                        Although there are 56 members of the Commonwealth of
                        Nations, there are 72 Commonwealth Games Associations.
                        They
                        are divided into 6 regions (Africa, Americas, Caribbean,
                        Europe, Asia and Oceania) and each of them has a similar
                        function to the National Olympic Committees in relation
                        with
                        their countries or territories. In some like India and
                        South
                        Africa, the CGA functions are assumed by their NOCs. One
                        of
                        the differences from other multisport events is that 15
                        CGAs
                        participating in the Commonwealth Games do not send
                        their
                        delegations independently from the Olympic, Paralympic
                        and
                        other multisports competitions, as 13 are linked to the
                        British Olympic Association, 1 is part of Australian
                        Olympic
                        Committee and another one is part of the New Zealand
                        Olympic
                        Committee as their Paralympic counterparts. They are:
                        the
                        four Home Nations of the United Kingdom (England,
                        Scotland,
                        Wales and Northern Ireland), the British Overseas
                        Territories (Anguilla, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar,
                        Montserrat, Saint Helena and Turks and Caicos Islands),
                        the
                        Crown Dependencies (Guernsey, Isle of Man, and Jersey),
                        Niue
                        and Norfolk Island send separate teams.[8] It is
                        expected
                        that Gabon and Togo will send a team for the first time
                        at
                        the 2026 Commonwealth Games, as the two countries were
                        admitted to the Commonwealth in June 2022 and they
                        didn’t
                        have time to organise their associations for the 2022
                        Games
                        which was scheduled for the end of July.

                        20 cities in nine countries (counting England, Scotland
                        and
                        Wales separately) have hosted the games. Australia has
                        hosted the Commonwealth Games five times (1938, 1962,
                        1982,
                        2006 and 2018 and will host the next edition in 2026),
                        more
                        than any other nation. Two cities have hosted
                        Commonwealth
                        Games more than once: Auckland (1950, 1990) and
                        Edinburgh
                        (1970, 1986).[9]

                        Only six nations have participated in every Commonwealth
                        Games: Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Scotland
                        and
                        Wales. Of these six, Australia, England, Canada and New
                        Zealand have each won at least one gold medal in every
                        Games. Australia has been the highest achieving team for
                        thirteen editions of the Games, England for seven, and
                        Canada for one. These three teams also top the all-time
                        Commonwealth Games medal table in that order.

                        The ongoing Commonwealth Games, the 22nd, are being held
                        in
                        Birmingham from 28 July to 8 August 2022. The next
                        Commonwealth Games will be the first games in history
                        held
                        in a decentralized way, as they are scheduled to be
                        hosted
                        across four cities in the Australian state of Victoria
                        from
                        17 to 29 March 2026.

                        The ending performance is today - Monday 8th August.
