            <p>Two way radios in cars were the ancestors of today's mobile
                phones. Before radio telephones, telecommunications depended
                upon wire or cable links which were pioneered in the 1830's and
                1840's.
                In 1910 Lars Magnus Ericsson installed a telephone in his car,
                although this was not a radio telephone. While travelling across
                the country, he would stop at a place where telephone lines were
                accessible and using a pair of long electric wires he could
                connect to the national telephone network. In Europe, radio
                telephony was first used on the first-class passenger trains
                between Berlin and Hamburg in 1926. Later radio telephony was
                introduced on a large scale in German tanks during the Second
                World War.
                In the 1950's two-way radios were used in vehicles such as
                police cars and taxicabs, but they were not true mobile phones
                because they were not normally connected to the telephone
                network. Users could not dial numbers from their vehicles. A
                large community of mobile radio users, known as the mobilisers,
                popularized the technology that would eventually give way to the
                mobile phone. During the early 1940s, Motorola developed a
                backpacked two-way radio, the Walkie-Talkie and later developed
                a large hand-held two-way radio for the US military.

            <h2>The first true mobile phones</h2>
            <p>Leonid Kupriyanovich from Moscow developed the portable mobile
                phone. It consisted of a small sized handset equipped with an
                antenna and rotary dial communicated with a base station.
                Kupriyanovich's "radiophone" had 3 kilogram of total weight,
                could operate up to 20 or 30 kilometers, and had 20 or 30 hours
                of battery lifespan. Up to 1967, each mobile phone had to stay
                within the area serviced by one base station throughout the
                phone call. This did not provide continuity of automatic
                telephone service to mobile phones moving through several cell
                areas.</p>
