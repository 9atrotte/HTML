            <h1>The modern cell phone</h1>
            <p>
                The origin of the modern cell phone can be traced back to 1973
                when
                Motorola invented the first cellular portable telephone to be
                commercialized, known as Motorola DynaTAC 8000X. Martin Cooper,
                a
                Motorola researcher and executive is considered to be the
                inventor
                of this mobile phone which was small enough to be carried around
                and
                did not have to be based in a vehicle.
                The main technological development that distinguished the First
                Generation mobile phones from the previous generation was the
                use of
                multiple cell sites, and the ability to transfer calls from one
                site
                to the next as the user travelled between cells during a
                conversation. The first commercially automated cellular network
                (the
                1G generation) was launched in Japan by NTT in 1979 and covered
                Tokyo's 20 million inhabitants with a cellular network of 23
                base
                stations. 1G (First Generation) mobile phone networks used
                analogue
                technology, had low traffic capacity, poor voice quality and
                poor
                security.
            </p>
            <h2>Second (2G) and Third Generation (3G) cell phones</h2>
            <p>
                2G networks used purely digital technology. Unlike 1G networks,
                they
                allowed text messaging and caller identity. 2.5 or Second
                Generation
                Enhanced networks lie between 2G and 3G and allowed web
                browsing,
                navigational maps, voice mail and the sending and receiving of
                email
                messages. 3G, networks, which became well established by the end
                of
                2007, support much higher data transmission rates. Many new
                services
                include TV streaming and video conferencing.

            <h2>Types of mobile phones available</h2>
            <p>
                Mobile phones could be placed into two simple categories -
                conventional phones and smart phones. Conventional phones are
                cheaper and compact, with pre-paid quickly becoming the leading
                low-price option. All allow you to store frequently used numbers
                and
                to send and receive text messages. They now offer a range of
                other
                features including cameras and options for custom ring tones,
                games,
                and other services. Smart phones have now spread from business
                users, like travelling salesmen keeping up with email, to
                ordinary
                consumers. They can often handle office documents, like
                spreadsheets
                and can access a host of applications like multimedia, games,
                travel, news, weather, and finance.
